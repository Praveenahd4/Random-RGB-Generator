# Random RGB Generator

The Random RGB Generator is a simple yet fascinating Android app developed using Jetpack Compose. It showcases the power of modern UI development with Kotlin. The app features a single screen that displays a color board. Each time the user taps the "Generate new color" button, the board changes to a new color, displaying its RGB (Red, Green, Blue) value. This project aims to provide a straightforward example of managing state and responding to user input in a Compose UI.

## Features

- **Generate Color**: Tap the button to generate a random color displayed on the screen.
- **Display RGB Values**: Alongside the color, see the exact RGB values that constitute it.
- **Simple UI**: A minimalist design focusing on functionality and ease of use.

2. Open the project in Android Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## How It Works

The app utilizes Kotlin's `Random` class to generate the RGB values and Jetpack Compose for the UI. When the "Generate new color" button is clicked, the app generates a new set of RGB values and updates the state, which is reflected in the color displayed on the screen.
